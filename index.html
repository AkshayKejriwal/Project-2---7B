        <p> <h4> Hi, my name is <b></b>Akshay Kejriwal.</b> I study in the 7th Grade in the <u>Bombay International School.</u>
        I live in Worli Naka in <i>Mumbai, India.</i> My passions are playing drums and squash. I also occasionally like to play football and cricket. I love doing math and logial thinking sums 
    which I find really fun. I even play music in a band with some of my school friends. <br><br>
My goals for this year are to do well in academics and learn a lot of things in different subjects which I can apply in real life. I also want to finish Trinity Grade 6 in drums 
and start playing a sport more seriously. <br> <br> 
My favourite place to travel to is Europe. My favourite restaurant is Kai Mayfair in London. It is a michelin star Chinese restaurant and they even have a whole vegetarian menu.
I also love going to water parks and doing the really big rides. They are scary but also very enjoyable. I also like cars and know quite a bit about cars. My favourite brand is Lamborghini
and I hope to have one when I grow up.</h4> </p>
